Introduction
This document details what information we may hold about you, why we hold it, and how we may use it.

What we store
When you sign up to Worthy Work, the personal information stored by us will be used only for the activities related to Worthy Work. You also choose a password and select a charity to support.

We store information regarding your activity on Worthy Work, including the goods you donate and technical information such as your browser and IP address. We may use external tools, such as Google Analytics, to collect such information. We may also share your personal information with our associates/affiliates which will help us to improve or services & logistics.

How we contact you
By signing up to Worthy Work, you agree to our terms and conditions. This includes giving us permission to send you promotional emails relating to Worthy Work and other products and services we may offer. We may also contact you over phone for any queries regarding your account or donations.
If you contact us, for instance via phone or email, you give us permission to contact you relating to your query. Doing so will not result in your details being added to any promotional email lists.
If you have provided us with your contact information in person, for example at an industry event, then we may be able to contact you including sending a follow-up email or promotional emails. This will depend on the circumstances in which you provided your information.


How we use your information
The personal information we store may be used to tailor our service to you. 
We may also use your information - including personal, technical and usage data - for internal purposes such as statistical analysis. This is so that we can understand how our services are being used and to aid the decisions we make.

How data may be shared
We may share your personal information with our associates/affiliates enabling them to contact you and you will be subject to their own privacy policy.
If you make a claim for an incorrect donation, or having contacted us with a query regarding a donation, you agree that we may share information relating to the purchase with the associate/affiliate concerned. This is for the investigation of the claim/query and the information is used for no other purposes.
The associate/affiliate has requested information for the purposes of fraud prevention or for legal reasons.
As we often work with associates/affiliates via third parties (such as technology providers and affiliate networks), your personal information may be shares but only for the prescribed purposes.
We may use a variety of tools and services - including, but not limited to, email marketing tools, Facebook advertising tools, and Google advertising/analytical tools - which may involve uploading and processing your data in order to provide a service to us.
Outside of these scenarios, we do not pass your personal data onto any third parties without your explicit content.

Security
We endeavour to follow best practices and fulfil all legal obligations with regards to the security of your data and personal information.

In order to access your account with us, you choose a password. It is also your responsibility to keep your password safe. 
We cannot take responsibility if you voluntarily or involuntarily enable someone else to access your account and gain access to any personal information stored.
You may change your password at any time via your account.

Cookies
Cookies are small text files placed on your device by websites. The information cannot be seen by any other websites (so the information is secure) and is used by us to provide features to aid the use of our services.
Cookies need to be enabled in order for you to access your account, whilst the tracking of donations relies upon cookies. Therefore, the intended use of Worthy Work requires cookies to be enabled.
