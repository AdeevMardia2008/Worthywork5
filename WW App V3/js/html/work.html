            About us

Worthy Work is the idea of 12 year old programmer Adeev Mardia living in Chennai, India. With interest in playing guitar, playing football & starting his very own kitchen called Bite Size, it was time to get involved to be of use to the very society we live in. Thus, emerged Worthy Work.
Worthy Work is a platform on which the users can donate their not-in-use and no-more-in use goods to us which in turn will be donated to various non profit organizations tied up with us to put these things to good use. 
We urge people to join our community and donate things like electronics, furniture, garments, footwear, etc. which they no longer use (but are in working & wearable condition). We will collect these goods from the donor & hand it over to the various organizations who will bring these items back to life by using it.
Together we can do our part & gift happiness to try to bring a smile on each & every face making our societies a happy & better place to live in.
